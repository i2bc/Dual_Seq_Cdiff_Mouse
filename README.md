# Dual_Seq_Cdiff_Mouse

Repository to reproduce the analyses in Kreis _et al._ 202< : "Dual RNA-seq study of the dynamics of coding and non-coding RNAs expression during Clostridioides difficile infection in a mouse model"

The analysis process consists of several parts: quality control (01), cleaning (02), mapping (03), prediction of new candidate ncRNA genes (04), counting the reads associated with each gene (05), analysis of differential gene expression (06), and comparisons with similar analyses already published (07).

## Dual-RNAseq analysis

Dual-RNAseq data is available under identifier [PRJEB64651](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB64651).

### prediction of new candidate ncRNA genes

The prediction of new candidate ncRNA genes was done with [DETR'PROK, 2.1.3 version](http://rssf.i2bc.paris-saclay.fr/Software/detrprok.php):


## Comparisons with similar published analyses

For this part, the entire analysis workflow (01-06) was taken over in the form of a snakemake pipeline, as the data were not from a dual-RNAseq and therefore required adaptation.
